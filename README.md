# Data Science Basics - Daily Learnings

Welcome to my **Data Science Basics** repository! In this repository, I will be documenting my daily learning journey as I go through various data science topics, tutorials, and exercises. The content will primarily focus on foundational concepts, tools, and techniques used in the field of data science.

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of my notes, code, and projects during my **Data Science Basics** course. It will include:
- Python tutorials
- Data manipulation and visualization techniques
- Machine learning algorithms and models
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical methods and concepts

I am using various libraries such as `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Scikit-learn`, and others to practice and apply my knowledge.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this course, I aim to:
- Master the basics of Python programming for data science.
- Gain hands-on experience with data manipulation and cleaning.
- Understand and apply basic machine learning algorithms.
- Develop skills in data visualization and storytelling.
- Learn to work with real-world datasets and solve business problems.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Data Storage**: CSV, Excel, SQL

## Daily Learning Logs

Each day, I will commit my learnings to this repository. The learning logs will include:
- Code examples and explanations
- Visualizations of data
- Step-by-step tutorials and guides
- Resources such as articles, blog posts, or videos

Check out the daily learning logs in the following folders:
- `Day_1`: Introduction to Python
- `Day_2`: Pandas Basics
- `Day_3`: Data Visualization with Matplotlib
- ... and more as I progress.
